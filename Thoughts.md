# **A multi-agent chatbot system utilizing Llama-Index and LangChain to enable modular, task-oriented, and scalable interaction pipelines.
System Components**

## Chatbot Backend

**Programming Language:** Python

**Libraries:**

    LangChain: Framework for constructing agents.
    LlamaFile: Efficient file processing.
    OpenAI: Language model support.
    Wisper: Audio synthesis.
    Coqui: Speech synthesis.
    Text-to-Speech (KaljaB): TTS integration.
    Speech-to-Text (KoljaB): STT integration.

**User Interaction Modes:

    CLI: Text-based interface.
    GUI: Graphical user interface.
    TTS + STT: Voice input/output.

**Interaction Flow:

    User → Chatbot
        CLI / GUI / TTS + STT: Various input/output formats.

## Agent Backend

**Libraries:**

    Llama-Index: Index and retrieval.
    LangChain: Agent orchestration.

Interaction Flow:**

    User → Chatbot → Concierge → Supervisor → Specialized Team

**Multi-Agent Concierge: The Concierge decomposes tasks into subtasks and routes them to the appropriate teams through a LangChain Supervisor.**

**Pipeline:**
    User interacts with the Chatbot.
    Chatbot forwards user input to the Multi-Agent Concierge.
    The Concierge:
        Breaks the task into first-step subtasks.
        Assigns subtasks to the LangChain Supervisor.
    The LangChain Supervisor:
        Determines which team executes which subtask.
    Teams perform their specialized roles and return results via the pipeline.

**Communication Chain:**

    User ↔ Chatbot
    Chatbot ↔ Concierge
    Concierge ↔ Supervisor
    Supervisor ↔ Teams
    Teams ↔ Team Leaders

**Specialized Teams**

**Teams are categorized by their area of expertise for handling subtasks efficiently.**
